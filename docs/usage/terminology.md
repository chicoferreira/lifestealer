# Terminology

## Hearts

**Hearts** represent a core mechanic in Lifestealer. In Minecraft, one heart typically equals 2 health points. In
Lifestealer, hearts are both a visual and functional measure of a player's status.

## Maximum Hearts

**Maximum Hearts** denote the upper limit of hearts a player can achieve. Players won't be able to consume more hearts
if they have this threshold.

## Minimum Hearts

**Minimum Hearts** define the lower threshold of hearts a player must maintain. Dropping below this value will trigger
a ban.

## Modifier

A **Modifier** is an value that can be assigned to each player that will be added to the base value to calculate the
final result. Each player can have maximum hearts, minimum hearts, ban time and return hearts modifiers.

Check [Rules](/usage/rules) for more information.

## Return Hearts

**Return Hearts** are the number of hearts a player receives when they rejoin the server after a ban.
