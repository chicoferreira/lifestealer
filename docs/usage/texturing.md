# Adding custom textures to the heart item

Lifestealer allows you to customize the appearance of heart items using custom textures. This is accomplished by setting
the `custom model data` property in your heart item configuration, which works in tandem with a properly configured
resource pack.

This guide does not cover how to create or distribute a resource pack, but you can find numerous guides and video
tutorials online that walk you through the process.

**Note:** Lifestealer only supports the older texture format, which requires custom model data to be identified by
integer values and not by strings.
