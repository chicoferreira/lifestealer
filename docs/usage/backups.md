# Backups

Lifestealer does not have a built-in backup system. This is something that will be added in the future. For now,
you can use the export feature to create backups of your data.

To create a backup, you can use the `/lifestealer export` command. This will create a file in the `exports` folder named
with the current date.

You can import the information in this file back using the `/lifestealer import <path>` command.
