# The name of the item in the list above that should be dropped when a player dies
# To avoid confusion and misuse, this must exist in the "items" list above
# The amount of hearts the player will lose will be the same as the "heart amount" defined in the item (unless changed by other plugin that hooks into Lifestealer)
item to drop when player dies: "default"

# The amount of hearts a player should start with when they first join the server, a heart consists of 2 health points
starting hearts: 10

# Define rules that will change values based on player's permissions
rules:
  # The rules that will be applied to players that don't have any of the groups below (not to be confused with the "default" item, these are not related)
  default:
    # The maximum amount of hearts a player can have
    max hearts: 10
    # The minimum amount of hearts a player can have
    min hearts: 5
    # The amount of time a player will be banned for if they lose more than the minimum amount of hearts
    ban time: 1d 12h 30m
  # Rules overrides applied to players with specific permissions
  groups:
    # If the player has permission "vip"
    - permission: "vip"
      # Change the maximum amount of hearts to 15
      max hearts: 15
      # and the minimum amount of hearts to 3
      min hearts: 3
      # The ban time will be the same as the default
    # If the player has permission "admin"
    - permission: "admin"
      # Change the maximum amount of hearts to 20
      max hearts: 20
      # and the ban time to 0 seconds
      ban time: 0s
    # If the player has multiple groups, the overrides will be applied in the order they are defined here
    # So if a player has both "vip" and "admin" permissions, they will have 30 max hearts, 3 min hearts and a ban time of 0 seconds

  # The chat, action bar, title and subtitle components are formatted using the MiniMessage format.
